# Information_Generator
A project to create randomly generated fake phone numbers that is quickly spiraling out to create all sorts of random information.

## Long Requested(by no one) Fake Phone Number Generator Added
Added to this project has been the one and only feature asked for, the generation of fake phone numbers. Now, it is entirely possible that phone numbers currently in
in use could be generated by this script, but it isn't our intention to actually do that, nor do we recommend trying to call any of the numbers, or, try to use any
of the generated numbers for your next cell phone contract number, no matter how awesome the number may be.
